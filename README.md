# FriendlyBrowser
The web browser to rule them all.

FriendlyBrowser is a web browser application made with MIT’s App Inventor that aims to give users the latest-version-of-Google type web viewing experience, no matter how old their phone, or their operating system is. It is inspired by GvBrowser.

It contains features that old phones running really old versions of Google or other web browsers would otherwise not have, plus some extras, like a built-in ad blocker.

FriendlyBrowser is currently in developement, with a full release expected soon. Releases will soon be available here and potentially even on Codeberg.
